A variation on the original package at https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting that achieves creation of external files that can be loaded at runtime, rather than the ScriptableObject asset from the original.
Currently this is only a proof of concept and the runtime loading is a test using a hard-coded path.
